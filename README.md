This Bot Is Based From My Verified Bot Cheese, I Decided To Make A Copy Open Source!
Making This Choice Was A "Do I Do I Not" Moment As Sometimes My Bots Break Unconditionally, Which Can Be A Pain To Someone Who Wants A Bot Based On My Verified Cheese Bot!

You Will Be Needing THe Latest Node (V16.13) From https://nodejs.org/en/ I Have Not Tested The Bot With The Current (V17) Use At Your Own Risk! This Also Requires Basic Discord.js Understanding! Read On The Docs: https://discord.js.org/#/ This Is A Extremely Basic Bot So It Shouldnt Need Much Tweaks!

Remove The example- From The example-config And Fill In The Token And Custom The Prefix To Your Liking!
